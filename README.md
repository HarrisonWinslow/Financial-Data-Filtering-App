# Instructions to clone and run locally

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following tools installed:

* Node.js (includes npm)
* Git

You can verify if these are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
node -v
npm -v
git --version
```

## Steps to Create and Run the React Application
### 1. Clone the Repository
If you havenâ€™t already, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command (make sure to clone the 'master' branch!):

```
git clone -b master https://github.com/HarrisonWinslow/Financial-Data-Filtering-App.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Folder
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory:

```
cd your-repository
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager):

```
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

### 4. Start the Development Server
After the dependencies are installed, start the React development server:

```
npm start
```

This will start the app and open it in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

The app will automatically reload if you make any edits to the code.
